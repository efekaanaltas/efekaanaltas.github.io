Efe Kaan Alta≈ü, Turkiye/Samsun.
I like making/playing games, math, physics, programming, philosopy, drawing, modelling, voice acting, film making, talking with friends and eating.
I also want to learn how to make music.
I used Unity for a long time but now I'm developing **Accord** in my custom engine **Cockroach** using C++.
I hate a large portion of modern software and the internet.
